# Setting up the Project

First you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the package manager
that comes with it: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Once you've got that working, head to the command line where we'll set
up our project.

## Set up

```
cd react
git checkout start
npm start
```

Now open up http://localhost:8080
